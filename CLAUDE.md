## Project Overview

Inkwell is a WYSIWYG Markdown editor for React, built on Slate.js. The editor
content model is the Markdown source string. Markdown syntax is part of the
content; visual formatting is computed at render time and is never stored as a
separate rich-text model.

## Monorepo Structure

pnpm workspaces + Turborepo monorepo. Three packages, all in one workspace:

```
packages/
  inkwell/                     Library package: @railway/inkwell
    src/
      index.ts                 Public exports
      types.ts                 Public TypeScript types
      components/              Shared block components (Heading, Blockquote, …)
                               consumed by both editor and renderer surfaces
      mdast/                   Markdown ↔ mdast helpers (parse, stringify)
      editor/inkwell-editor.tsx
      editor/slate/            Slate model, serialize/deserialize, features
      renderer/                Read-only renderer + renderer utilities
      plugins/                 Built-in plugins and tests
  inkwell-docs/                Astro Starlight docs + React demo island
```

### Shared block components

`src/components/` holds the React components both surfaces render:
`Heading`, `Blockquote`, `CodeBlock`, `List`, `ListItem`, `Image`.
Each accepts `surface: "editor" | "renderer"` so the editor-only
`inkwell-editor-*` classes are added on the editor surface and omitted
on the renderer surface (the renderer relies on
`.inkwell-renderer <tag>` descendant selectors).

The renderer registers these via rehype-react's `components` map in
`src/components/renderer-bindings.tsx`. The editor's
`render-element.tsx` invokes them directly with Slate's `attributes`
spread. The DOM-parity test (`src/dom-parity.test.tsx`) guards that
the block markup shape stays aligned across both surfaces.

## Commands

Run from the workspace root:

- `pnpm test` — Run all tests via turbo
- `pnpm dev` — Start docs dev server
- `pnpm build` — Build all packages
- `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` — Biome
- `pnpm changeset` — Add a changelog entry

Package-scoped validation used during API work:

- `pnpm --filter=@railway/inkwell typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter=@railway/inkwell test`
- `pnpm --filter=@railway/inkwell build`
- `pnpm --filter=inkwell-docs typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter=inkwell-docs build`

## Public API

`<InkwellEditor />` is the primary editor API.

```tsx
import { InkwellEditor } from "@railway/inkwell";
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [content, setContent] = useState("# Hello **world**");

  return <InkwellEditor content={content} onChange={setContent} />;
}
```

Use `ref={useRef<InkwellEditorHandle>(null)}` for imperative actions:

- `getState()`
- `focus({ at?: "start" | "end" })`
- `clear({ select?: "start" | "end" | "preserve" })`
- `setContent(content, { select?: "start" | "end" | "preserve" })`
- `insertContent(content)`

`setContent()` and `clear()` do not call `onChange`. `insertContent()` behaves
like a normal edit and flows through change handling.

The editor handle stays plugin-agnostic. Plugins that need an imperative
surface (e.g. click-to-attach for attachments) expose their own ref via
plugin options — see `AttachmentsHandle` and the `ref` option on
`createAttachmentsPlugin`.

The root package exports the component APIs, built-in plugin factories, renderer
utilities (`parseMarkdown(content, options)`, `htmlToMarkdown(html)`), and public
types. `RehypePluginConfig` accepts plugin tuples with rest options:
`[plugin, ...options]`. Do not export internal Slate helpers or shared plugin
primitives from the root API.

## Unified mdast pipeline

Both surfaces parse the same way. `src/mdast/parse.ts` exposes
`parseMarkdownToMdast(content)`, which runs `remark-parse` + `remark-gfm`
with Inkwell's parse-shaping plugins (`remarkNoTables`,
`remarkNoThematicBreak`, and one of the soft-break shapers) and returns
a single mdast `Root` with position info on every block.

`parseMarkdownToMdast` also escapes bare `>` line markers (`>foo`
without a trailing space) to `\>` before parsing, so CommonMark doesn't
treat them as blockquotes — Inkwell only models the space-prefixed `> `
form as structural. The escape is **fence-aware**: a line scanner skips
lines inside fenced code blocks (``` ` ``` and `~`, including unclosed
fences), because code content is verbatim — a blind escape baked a
literal `\` into `code.value` on both surfaces (`>>> doctest` →
`\>>> doctest`). The escape inserts a byte, which shifts every
downstream mdast `position.offset`, so the tree is remapped back to
original-source offsets after parsing. **Never slice the original
source with raw post-parse offsets** — they index the escaped string,
and that desync silently dropped a leading char from every block after
a bare-`>` line (`bar` → `ar`). The remap tracks visited `Point`
objects by identity because plugins (the soft-break paragraph splitter)
may alias one Point into several nodes' positions — remapping an
aliased Point twice double-subtracts. Documents with no bare-`>` line
skip the remap entirely, so the common path is untouched.

The soft-break shapers receive the (escaped) source via their `source`
option and derive real `position` info for split text parts by offset
arithmetic — **split paragraphs must stay positioned**. A positionless
split paragraph falls back to `mdastToString` in the editor adapter
(inline markers vanish from the model) and gets no source-cache entry.
When a text node's source slice doesn't byte-match its value (entity or
escape decoding), the splitter deliberately leaves parts positionless
and the cache skips those blocks — canonical fallback, never a guessed
slice.

Two adapters consume that tree:

- `src/mdast/to-slate.ts` (`mdastToSlate(tree, content)`) — used by the
  editor's `deserialize`. Container blocks (blockquote, list, list-item)
  convert structurally. Leaf-bearing blocks (paragraph, heading) pull
  the verbatim source slice via mdast `position.offset` so D1=visible
  markers (`**bold**`, `[label](url)`, `# `) stay as text in the slate
  node. Standalone images (`![alt](url)` on their own line) promote to
  top-level void image elements — Slate's arrow-key navigation needs a
  block-level void to land on.
- `src/renderer/...` (rehype-react via `parseMarkdown`) — used by
  `<InkwellRenderer>`. Same mdast tree, projected through
  `mdast-util-to-hast` to HTML.

The reverse direction is `src/mdast/from-slate.ts`
(`slateToMdast(nodes)`). Inline content is re-parsed through `remark`
so `Strong` / `Emphasis` / `Link` / etc. nodes are recovered before
`stringifyMdast` (which wraps `mdast-util-to-markdown` + the `gfm`
extension) emits the source. Container empty-paragraph handling:
list items drop all empty paragraphs (`"none"` policy); blockquotes
keep leading and trailing empty paragraphs but drop **internal**
empties (`"edges"` policy) so the natural mdast paragraph separator
isn't doubled.

`stringifyMdast` post-processes the toMarkdown output to strip a few
defensive escapes Inkwell doesn't need:

- Escaped thematic-break lines (`\---` and the per-character forms
  `\*\*\*` / `\_\_\_` / `\* \* \*` — unneeded under
  `remarkNoThematicBreak`; only lines consisting entirely of marker
  characters are unescaped)
- `\[` / `\]` (link-bracket protection — Inkwell stores link source
  verbatim in text)
- Trailing `&#x20;` (trailing-whitespace protection)
- `\>` after a blockquote prefix (so legacy text-leaf blockquotes
  round-trip nested-quote markers cleanly)

It also collapses runs of consecutive bare-`>` lines to a single `>`.

The whole post-process is **code-aware**: a line walker tracks fenced
code (including blockquote-prefixed fences) and leaves fence content
untouched, and the bracket strip skips inline code spans. toMarkdown
emits code verbatim, so any backslash, entity, or `>` line inside code
is the user's actual content — a blind strip corrupted edited code
blocks (`` `\[a-z]` `` lost its backslash; `>`-only code lines were
collapsed). Likewise `serialize()` trims newlines only at block-piece
*edges* before joining — a document-wide `\n{3,}` collapse used to eat
blank-line runs inside fenced code even for untouched cached blocks.

`deserialize` for single-line plain-text input bypasses the slice path
and keeps `content` verbatim as paragraph text. Paste paths feed text
like `" there"` through `deserialize` and need the leading whitespace
preserved (mdast normally strips it from paragraph source slices).

The line-based regex deserialize/serialize is gone. Don't reintroduce
a per-line scanner — when fixing a corner case, fix it inside the
adapters or in `stringifyMdast`'s post-process.

### Source cache

Untouched blocks round-trip byte-for-byte through a per-block source
cache keyed by Slate node id. `deserializeWithRanges` returns
`(BlockLineRange | null)[]` derived from mdast position info — `null`
for blocks with no position (synthetic plugin nodes), which
`populateSourceCacheFromParse` **skips** rather than guessing a slice
(a fabricated `{0,0}` range once cached the document's first line as
every positionless block's source, and the self-derived canonical
always matched — soft-wrapped docs serialized as line 0 repeated).
Documents containing `\r` skip caching entirely: lone CRs desync the
`\n`-based line slicing, and CRLF slices would splice mixed line
endings into output — both degrade to the canonical (LF-normalized)
form instead. On serialize, `slateToMdast` runs first, but a
top-level block whose canonical re-stringification matches its cached
canonical form short-circuits and re-emits the original slice
verbatim. Style normalizations (`*` → `-`, `> a\n> b` → `> a\n>\n>
b`, tight nested lists) only fire for blocks the user has actually
edited.

Soft-wrapped paragraphs (`a\nb`) split into sibling blocks — that IS
the editor model — so the single-newline gap normalizes to a blank
line on serialize: the per-block cache cannot express "no blank line
between blocks". At top level, inline markers survive the split via
verbatim slices (positioned parts). Inside containers (blockquote /
list-item), the text-node value never byte-matches its source slice
(the slice carries `> `/indent prefixes), so split parts stay
positionless there — `mdastToSlate` falls back to re-stringifying the
inline children (`inlineFallback` in to-slate.ts), which preserves
`**`/link structure at the cost of canonical escape normalization.
Don't swap that fallback back to `mdast-util-to-string` — the flat
text dropped markers and link URLs from the model entirely.

## Editor Rendering Model

Formatting is feature-based. The public prop is `features`.
All features are enabled by default:

- `headings` with optional `h1`–`h6` overrides
- `blockquotes` (nestable — `blockquote` elements hold block children;
  the `> ` marker is structural and is not stored on any inner text
  leaf, the editor re-emits it on serialize)
- `codeBlocks` — each fenced block becomes a single `code-block` element
  with a multi-line text leaf and an optional `lang` property. The
  fences themselves are structural; serialize wraps the text back in
  ` ```lang ` / ` ``` `. Editor renders as `<pre data-lang="…"><code>…</code></pre>`;
  `white-space: pre-wrap` on `.inkwell-editor-code-block` keeps caret
  placement aligned with the visual line breaks.
- `images`

Lists are not a feature-flag (they're always recognized). A run of
`<marker> content` lines (unordered `-`/`*`/`+` or ordered `<n>.`)
deserializes to a `list` element with `list-item` children. Each item
holds a paragraph + an optional nested list. The marker is structural —
serialize re-emits it. Editor renders as `<ul>`/`<ol>` + `<li>`. `Tab`
inside a list-item nests it under its previous sibling (creating or
reusing a nested list); `Shift+Tab` un-nests one level. Ordered lists
remember a non-default starting number on the list element's `start`
property and emit `<ol start="…">` accordingly.

Images are top-level void blocks. A standalone `![alt](url)` line
deserializes to a top-level `image` element (rather than the mdast-
native `paragraph > image` shape) so Slate's arrow-key navigation has
a block-level stop to land on. The editor renders the image inside a
`<div class="inkwell-editor-image"><img/></div>` for selection chrome.
`insertImage` / `updateImage` / `removeImage` on the plugin editor
walk the tree to find images by id.

## Source cache

The editor maintains a per-instance `SourceCache` (see
`src/editor/slate/source-cache.ts`) so untouched top-level blocks
round-trip byte-for-byte through deserialize → serialize. Without it,
`> a\n> b` would normalize to `> a\n>\n> b`; `***` would normalize to
`\*\*\*`; `* one\n* two` would normalize to `- one\n- two` — all valid
mdast canonical forms but stylistically jarring to a user who didn't
touch the block.

The cache is keyed by Slate node id and stores
`{ source, canonical }` per top-level block. Populated at parse time
(deserialize tracks line ranges; the orchestrator slices the original
`content` accordingly). On serialize, each top-level block recomputes
its canonical form and compares; matches emit the cached source slice,
misses fall back to canonical.

**Every** serialize path threads the cache — `getState`, the character
count, `onSubmit`, the `onChange` emission in `handleChange`, and the
copy/cut `text/plain` payload (`setFragmentData` reads the cache via
the internal `editor.sourceCache` field wired at editor creation). They
must stay aligned: if `onChange` serialized without the cache it would
emit normalized untouched siblings (`*` → `-`, expanded blockquotes)
while `getState` kept them verbatim, silently diverging a controlled
`onChange={setContent}` consumer's stored string from the editor. The
cache-faithful `onChange` is also what lets the `handleChange` echo
guard suppress the `onChange` that imperative `setContent`/`clear`
would otherwise leak (the prior dead `suppressImperativeOnChange` ref
never gated anything).

Invalidation rides on `editor.apply`: any op whose path touches a
top-level block (and `move_node`'s `newPath` as well) drops that
block's entry. This is broad — some edits that preserve canonical
shape still invalidate — but the fallback is just the canonical
form, which is correct. The cache lives outside Slate state, so
undo/redo doesn't have to thread through it; the canonical-equality
check naturally re-uses cache entries when the structure returns to
its previous shape.

Thematic breaks (`---` / `***` / `___` / `* * *` / `- - -`) are not
modeled. `remarkNoThematicBreak` rewrites every `thematicBreak` node
back to a paragraph in the parse pipeline, so these markers stay as
plain paragraph text in both surfaces (no `<hr>` rendering, no
decoration). A standard mdast `thematicBreak` carries no value, so the
plugin slices the **verbatim** marker from the parsed source by
`position.offset` (it takes the source string as a `source` option) —
otherwise the renderer would collapse every marker to `---` while the
editor's source slice kept the typed one, breaking WYSIWYG parity. The
`\---` / `\***` / `\___` defensive escapes mdast-util-to-markdown would
emit are stripped by `stringifyMdast`'s post-process.

List markers (`-`, `*`, `+`, `1.`) are structural (see the Lists
paragraph above — the editor re-emits them on serialize) and are not
part of configurable editor features.

Inline Markdown styling is still implemented internally with Slate decoration
ranges. Public docs should call the configurable behavior “features.”

Inline marks include `bold`, `italic`, `strikethrough`, `inlineCode`, and
their `*Marker` counterparts, plus link marks: `link` (visible link text
— covers both the `[text]` label of `[text](url)` and the entire text of
bare URL autolinks), `linkUrl` (URL token inside `(url)`), and
`linkMarker` (`[`, `]`, `(`, `)` brackets). Links are always on; the
content model stays the markdown source — no link nodes, no separate
rich-text model. `[text](url)` and bare URLs (`https://...`, `www....`)
are matched after the inline-code pass and skip ranges already covered
by backticks or another link. Trailing punctuation (`.,;:!?`) is
trimmed off bare-URL matches so "see https://x.com." doesn't pull the
period into the link.

Paste-over-selection: when the clipboard payload trims to a single URL
and the editor selection is non-empty, `withMarkdown`'s `insertData`
override replaces the selection with `[selected](url)` instead of
dropping the bare URL. Paste with a collapsed selection (or empty
editor) follows the normal markdown-deserialize path — the URL ends up
as plain text and the autolink decoration picks it up. There is no
bubble-menu "insert link" button (the symmetric `wrapSelection`
primitive doesn't fit `[text](url)`); editing the markdown source IS
the link editing UX.

Use slot styling:

- `className` aliases `classNames.root`
- `classNames.root`, `classNames.editor`
- `styles.root`, `styles.editor`

Do not add a public top-level `style` prop.

The bundled stylesheet ships **no container-size opinion** (`min-height`,
`max-height`, `height`) on `.inkwell-editor`. Container sizing is a
consumer decision — fights between the library default and a chat
composer / panel embed / custom layout were not worth shipping. Demos and
docs set their own size via `styles.editor`.

Every visual-chrome default the stylesheet ships — colors, backgrounds,
borders, padding, typography — is wrapped in `:where()` so it carries
0,0,0 specificity. That covers `.inkwell-editor` and its inline marks
(`strong`, `em`, `del`, `code`), the heading/blockquote block classes,
every `.inkwell-renderer <tag>` rule (links, headings, lists, code, `hr`,
images), the bubble menu chrome, and the shared plugin picker chrome.
The CSS-custom-property token definitions (both the light defaults and
the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block) are wrapped the same
way, so class-driven theming (e.g. `:root.dark .inkwell-renderer { ... }`)
works at single-class specificity without doubled-class hacks. Any
single-class consumer rule overrides them without `!important` or
descendant scoping. Don't move these rules back out of `:where()` —
`packages/inkwell/src/styles.test.ts` will fail at CI.

Typography and spacing are tokenized and shared across both surfaces so
the editor stays WYSIWYG with the renderer. Tokens live alongside the
color tokens in the 5-selector `:where()` block: `--inkwell-font-size`,
`--inkwell-line-height`, `--inkwell-heading-weight`,
`--inkwell-heading-line-height`, `--inkwell-h1-size`…`--inkwell-h6-size`,
`--inkwell-code-font-size`, `--inkwell-space-paragraph`,
`--inkwell-space-heading`, `--inkwell-space-blockquote`,
`--inkwell-space-list`, `--inkwell-space-list-item`,
`--inkwell-list-indent`, `--inkwell-space-code-block`,
`--inkwell-space-image`. Editor rules (`.inkwell-editor`,
`.inkwell-editor-blockquote`, `.inkwell-editor-heading-*`,
`.inkwell-editor-image`, `.inkwell-editor code`) and renderer rules
(`.inkwell-renderer`, `.inkwell-renderer h1`-`h6`, `.inkwell-renderer p`,
`.inkwell-renderer blockquote`, `.inkwell-renderer ul/ol/li`,
`.inkwell-renderer code/pre`, `.inkwell-renderer img`) consume the
tokens — the `styles.test.ts > references … in both editor and renderer`
cases enforce that the shared tokens stay referenced on both surfaces.
When adding a new typography or spacing rule, route it through a token
rather than a literal so both surfaces stay aligned.

Blank source lines do not produce empty-paragraph nodes. They flush
the current paragraph run; paragraph margins
(`--inkwell-space-paragraph`, shared with the renderer) handle the
visual gap between sibling blocks. Source round-trip fidelity comes
from the source cache; collapsed blank runs (3+ newlines between
blocks) normalize to one blank line.

What stays at normal specificity — and MUST stay there — is layout-critical
geometry: `.inkwell-editor-wrapper` (position relative anchors plugins),
`.inkwell-plugin-bubble-menu-container` and `.inkwell-plugin-picker-popup`
(positioning + z-index), `.inkwell-plugin-picker-list` (`max-height`
prevents viewport blowout), `.inkwell-editor-character-count` (top-right
overlay positioning — chrome is split into a sibling `:where()` rule),
`.inkwell-renderer-code-block` and `.inkwell-renderer-copy-btn`
(positioning), and `.inkwell-editor p` (`position: relative` only — its
margin is wrapped). The same rule of thumb when adding new styles: if
overriding a property with a consumer class would silently break
positioning or geometry, leave it unwrapped; otherwise wrap.

## Built-in Plugins

Built-in plugin factories:

- `createAttachmentsPlugin` — uploads can resolve to a URL string or
  `{ url, alt? }`. Image files insert inline; non-image files surface
  through optional `onAttachmentAdd(attachment)` so consumers can track
  them as message-level state (the markdown source has no syntax for
  arbitrary file attachments). Non-image files with no `onAttachmentAdd`
  pass through to default paste/drop. Accepts `ref?: RefObject<AttachmentsHandle | null>`
  populated on mount with `{ upload(files) }` for click-to-attach
  buttons — files filtered out by `accept` are silently skipped by
  `upload()` (paste/drop forwards them to default handling instead).
  The shared internal `routeFiles()` helper backs both paste and the
  imperative `upload()` so behavior stays identical.
- `createBubbleMenuPlugin` — `BubbleMenuOptions` is public for reusable
  menu configuration.
- `createCompletionsPlugin` — options type is `CompletionsPluginOptions`.
- `createEmojiPlugin` — custom item generics work when callers provide
  `emojis` or `search`.
- `createMentionsPlugin`
- `createSlashCommandsPlugin` — commands use one optional `arg`, not an
  `args` array.
- `createSnippetsPlugin`

`characterLimit` is a soft budget — typing past it is allowed. The editor
renders a built-in `count / limit` readout overlaying the top-right of the
wrapper (`.inkwell-editor-character-count`), but only once the count
reaches 80% of the limit (inclusive — at limit 50, the readout appears
at 40, not 39). Under the threshold the readout stays hidden so it
doesn't add visual noise to a near-empty editor. The readout sits on a
solid `var(--inkwell-bg)` background and is absolutely positioned, so it
visually layers above any text that wraps under it without shifting
content. It flips to red over the limit
(`.inkwell-editor-character-count-over`), the wrapper picks up
`.inkwell-editor-has-character-limit` whenever a limit is configured,
and gains `.inkwell-editor-over-limit` while
`characterCount > characterLimit` (bundled stylesheet paints a soft
red halo via `--inkwell-danger-soft` — intentionally muted, not a hard
ring). `InkwellEditorState.overLimit` mirrors the same condition.
`onCharacterCount` fires on every recount.

We previously tried hard-clamping (`with-character-limit`) but ran into
unfixable bypass paths in slate-react's native fast-path for ASCII typing
and various `Transforms.insertNodes` callers. The soft-limit + visual
signal is the chosen design — don't reintroduce a clamp without a
concrete reason.


## Plugin API

Plugins use explicit activation:

```ts
type InkwellPluginActivation =
  | { type: "always" }
  | { type: "trigger"; key: string }
  | { type: "manual" };
```

- Omitted activation defaults to `{ type: "always" }`.
- Trigger activation inserts/uses the trigger key and tracks the query after it.
- Manual activation is claimed with `ctx.activate({ query? })` and released with
  `ctx.dismiss()`.

Plugin callbacks receive a narrow `InkwellPluginEditor` controller. Do not expose
raw Slate editor instances in public plugin callbacks.

```ts
interface PluginKeyDownContext {
  editor: InkwellPluginEditor;
  wrapSelection: (before: string, after: string) => void;
  activate: (options?: { query?: string }) => void;
  dismiss: () => void;
}
```

Picker-style built-ins may share internal primitives, but those primitives are
not part of the root public API.

`PluginRenderProps` exposes both `position` (wrapper-relative caret coords with
a 4px gap below the caret — the default popup anchor) and `cursorRect`
(`{ top, bottom, left }`, wrapper-relative). Built-in pickers use a shared
internal `usePluginPopupPlacement` hook (in `plugins/plugin-picker.tsx`) to
flip above the caret when the popup would clip the editor wrapper's bottom or
the viewport bottom (whichever is more restrictive), and shift left when it
would overflow the right edge. The wrapper-bottom check catches short editors
(chat composers, compact embeds) where the popup would spill past the editor's
visible box even when the viewport has room. Flipped popups get the
`inkwell-plugin-picker-popup-flipped` class. The hook reads `popupEl.offsetParent`
to get the wrapper viewport position, so the picker must remain absolutely
positioned inside the editor wrapper.

## Code Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode, kebab-case file names (Biome enforced)
- No `any` unless required by third-party generic types and locally justified
- Keep imports at the top
- Tests live beside implementation files
- Every public API, type, CSS class, prop, export, or behavior change must update:
  - package docs under `packages/inkwell-docs/src/content/docs/docs/`
  - `packages/inkwell-docs/public/llms.txt`
  - this file when architecture/API guidance changes

## Known Issues / Pitfalls

- `parseHljsRanges` must handle hex/decimal HTML entities (`&#x3C;`)
- `parseHljsRanges` uses a class stack for nested hljs spans
- `computeDecorations` assumes a single text node per element
